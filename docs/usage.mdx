# Usage

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

export const Flag = ({children}) => (
  <strong style={{backgroundColor: 'red', padding: '1px'}}>({children})</strong>
)

export const Inputs = ({children, pattern}) => (
  <Admonition type="info" title="Pattern Input">
    <strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>{pattern}</code>
    <br/>
    <strong>Manual Settings:</strong> <code>{children}</code>
  </Admonition>
)

## Basic Usage

[Juggling Lab][1] (JL) supports hand siteswap sequences.
In order to simulate a pattern with OSS `42` and HSS `13`,
enter the OSS in the pattern field and enter the 
HSS in the "Manual Settings" field as `hss=13`.

<Flag>ADD IMAGE/SCREENSHOT</Flag>

See [Additional Settings](../settings) for other options.


Now we show the siteswap sequences of some known patterns and 
compare it with other existing notations.


## Solo Juggler Example

<Inputs pattern="42">hss=13</Inputs>

<Flag>insert gif</Flag>

* Common Interpretation: "Galloped" `423`
  - no straightforward way to mimic galloped timing in simulators
  - actual pattern looks rhythmic and not galloped
* JL asynchronous notation: `R4 R2x L4 L2x`
  - lengthy representation
  - need to change default dwell beats <Flag>find proper param name</Flag> 
    to a value less than `1`
  - does not optimize the dwell time to enable the `4` throws to be thrown lower
* JL synchronous notation: `(2, 2T)! (0, 2x)! (2T,2)! (2x, 0)!`
  - lengthy representation
  - why should we need synchronous notation for an asynchronous pattern
  - needs understanding of synchronous notation, throw modifiers and suppressed beats
