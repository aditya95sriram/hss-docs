# Usage

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';
import Gif from '../src/components/Gif';

export const Flag = ({children}) => (
  <strong style={{backgroundColor: 'red', padding: '1px'}}>({children})</strong>
)

export const Inputs = ({children, pattern}) => {
  return (
    <div className="row">
      <div className="col col--4">
        <Admonition type="info" title="Pattern Input">
          <strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>{pattern}</code>
          <br/>
          <strong>Manual Settings:</strong> <code>{children}</code>
        </Admonition>
      </div>
      <div className="col col--8">
        <Gif pattern={pattern}>{children}</Gif>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}


## Basic Usage

[Juggling Lab][1] (JL) supports hand siteswap sequences.
In order to simulate a pattern with OSS `42` and HSS `13`,
enter the OSS in the pattern field and enter the 
HSS in the "Manual Settings" field as `hss=13`.

See [Additional Settings](../settings) for other options.


Now we show the siteswap sequences of some known patterns and 
compare it with other existing notations.


## Solo Juggler Example

<Inputs pattern="42">hss=13</Inputs>

<Flag>insert gif</Flag>

* Common Interpretation: "Galloped" `423`
  - no straightforward way to mimic galloped timing in simulators
  - actual pattern looks rhythmic and not galloped
* JL asynchronous notation: `R4 R2x L4 L2x`
  - lengthy representation
  - need to change default dwell beats <Flag>find proper param name</Flag> 
    to a value less than `1`
  - does not optimize the dwell time to enable the `4` throws to be thrown lower
* JL synchronous notation: `(2, 2T)! (0, 2x)! (2T,2)! (2x, 0)!`
  - lengthy representation
  - why should we need synchronous notation for an asynchronous pattern
  - needs understanding of synchronous notation, throw modifiers
    and suppressed beats


## Asynchronous Prechac

<Inputs pattern="5">hss=4</Inputs>

<Flag>insert gif</Flag>

* Common (Prechac) interpretation: `2.5p`
  - Involves fractional throws and modifiers to indicate passes
  - Need modified average theorem and permutation test to check validity 
    and to determine the number of jugglers and objects
* JL synchronous notation: `<(0,5xp) (5xp,0) | (0,0)! (0,5p) (5p,0)!>`
  - Apart from synchronous notation, suppressed beats and throw modifiers,
    knowledge of passing notation is also needed to represent
    what is essentially an asynchronous pattern
* The OSS/HSS approach is how Tarim envisaged asynchronous Prechac patterns
  - Tarim suggested class of patterns which combined any oss with
    hss `2 Ã— numberOfJugglers`
  - Hand assignment imagined by Tarim was same as our default hand assignment

<Flag>add tarim reference</Flag>


## Pattern discovery

Combining any valid object siteswap sequence with any valid hand siteswap
sequence yields a valid pattern. For example:

<Inputs pattern="7">hss=423</Inputs>
<Flag>insert gif</Flag>

* Though all throws are 7's, the difficulty level for individual hands
  is different
* The hand throwing every third beat has the easiest role
* Roles can be identified and assigned to jugglers with different skill
  levels via the [`handspec`](../settings#handspec) feature
