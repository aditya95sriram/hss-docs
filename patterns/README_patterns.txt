Juggling Lab pattern list files
-------------------------------

These files are for use with Juggling Lab, the latest version of which can be
downloaded at https://jugglinglab.org.

Usage is fairly self-explanatory: Open a file in Juggling Lab, then click on
the items in the pattern list to see animations.

If you would like to contribute your own pattern files, please do! As of
version 1.5.2 it is easy to create and edit pattern lists in Juggling Lab.
Please use our file naming system to keep things organized: Prefix your files
with a unique personal identifier followed by '_'. You can send your files to
jboyce@gmail.com, or (better) submit them as a pull request on Github. I
periodically package the patterns into a zip archive for download at
https://jugglinglab.org.
